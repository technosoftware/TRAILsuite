 *
 * A break-inside of avoid is the one every engine implements, so the heading

 * into one unbreakable box asks for a box taller than the page, which an
 * engine resolves by breaking it anyway -- back where we started, and with the
 * itinerary starting on a fresh page for no reason. One block is always small
 * enough to move, and moving it is the whole of what is needed.
 *
 * The heading's own top margin collapses out through the wrapper, so the
 * spacing above a section is what it always was.
 *
 * It is here rather than in a sheet because it was written twice already. The
 * second copy arrived without the stylesheet rule that gives the wrapper its
 * meaning, so the markup was emitted for weeks by a sheet no engine had been
 * told to keep whole. A helper whose correctness depends on a rule in another
